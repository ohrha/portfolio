# Portfolio

A quick portfolio site, created as a way to display some of the project i've been involved in, as well as get 
to know Angular 5's built in service worker, and the new css grid module, now available in all major browsers.



## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
